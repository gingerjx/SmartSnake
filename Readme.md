## Done & TODO

**Done**

For now snake game is ready with all GUI components. Snake's moves are controlled by Reinforcement Learning mechanisms. QLearning is used to learn snake how to score the highest number of fruits and actions are chosen by QTable values.

**TODO**

There is few things to improve snake's learning. Firstly I will implement Function Approximation, for less memory usage. Later I will work on Deep QLearning approach.
