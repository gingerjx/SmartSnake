## Done & TODO

**Done**

For now snake game is ready with all GUI components. Snake's moves are controlled by Reinforcement Learning mechanisms. Function Approximation is used to estimate state value. State consists of four features. These features and corresponding weights are used to calculation of state value. Snake is learning by adjusting these weights. Using weights is instead of QTable, decrease memory usage, but increase learning time.

**TODO**

Deep QLearning.
